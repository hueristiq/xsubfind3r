# - `apk --no-cache add`: Installs additional required packages:
#   - `ca-certificates`: For managing CA certificates for secure communication.
#   - `curl`: For making HTTP requests (can be used to download files or for health checks).
#   - `gcc` and `g++`: The GNU Compiler Collection used for compiling C and C++ code, essential for building Go applications.
#   - `git`: Required for downloading Go modules that reference external repositories.
#   - `make`: Utility for automating build processes and running the `Makefile`.
